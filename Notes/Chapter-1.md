# Chapter 1

The essence of hacking is finding the unintended or overlook uses for the laws and properties of a given situation and then applying them in new and inventive ways to solve a problem. The earliest example of hackers is the MIT model railroad club. They were given a bunch of telephone equipment and they decided to rig up a complex system that allowed multiple operators to control different parts of the track by dialing in to the appropriate sections. This group began programming on punch cards and while everyone else was focused on just completing a task, they were focused on doing the task efficiently.

Hackers generally believe that information should be free and anything that stood in the way of that freedom should be circumvented. Some of these obstructions included authority figures, the bureaucracy of college classes, and discrimination.

Crackers were considered the "bad hackers", their intensions consisted of breaking the law rather than the pursuit of knowledge.

The term cracker originally was described as those who crack copyright software and reverse engineer copy-protection schemes. The current unpopularity related with the term comes from its two ambiguous definitions, those who engage in illegal activity and those who are generally unskilled (skiddies).

When laws seem to interfere with free speech, do the good guys who decide to speak their minds become inherently bad?
