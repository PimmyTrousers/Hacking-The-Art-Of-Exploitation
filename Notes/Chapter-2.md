# Chapter 2: Programming

Hacker is a term for both those who write code and those who exploit it. Since an understanding of programming helps hackers do their job, they tend to be relatively skilled when it comes to programming. Hackers on both sides of programming appreciate both the beauty and elegant code and the ingenuity of clever hacks.

In the modern day, programmers want their code to be functional rather than perfectly optimized. If they know that their program works in for all the cases that they want to, in a acceptable runtime then they wont be willing to spend 5 hours trying to make their program a little more efficient. This is becoming more and more true for the exponential growth that is occurring with computer memory and power.

An Assembler is one form of machine-language translator - it is a program that translates assembly language into machine-readable code. Assembly language is less cryptic that machine language but still not intuitive to write. Just as machine language for sparc processors, x86 assembly language is different from sparc's assembly language. A program written sing assembly language for one processor's architecture will not work on another processor's architecture.

Another way to mitigate the issue of having to write in shitty assembly code is to use a compiler. A compiler converts a high-level language into machine language. C, C++ and Fortran are all examples of high level languages.

Machine code --Assembler--> assembly code --Compiler--> high level language (C)
